# POMO BUDDY

### Your moderately-condescending inspirational little Pomodoro study-buddy

Pomo-Buddy is a wee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a> timer that keeps you
on-track in your studies or your work! He will be there for you with inspirational, maybe *slightly* condescending
quotes to keep you going and no amount of work or adversity can slap that smile off his face!

### Learning Outcomes

My learning outcomes for this project were to create a Pomodoro timer to continue applying my knowledge of TypeScript
and to learn TailwindCSS.
Tailwind has been an utter blast to work with, and its utility-first approach is incredible in versatility and
modularity. Additionally, I can say that the Tailwind team has chosen wonderful colors, it's hard to get a poor-looking
combination through accident with their well-chosen palettes!

In addition to technologies, I also decided to put a creative flair on this project and drew the Pomodoro buddy myself.
